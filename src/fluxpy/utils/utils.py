    This function optimizes the given metabolic model to identify reactions involving a specified metabolite.

    in a DataFrame.

        - The function assumes the model is properly optimized and that each reaction's flux can be accessed via the solution object.
        - Reactions with a flux less than 0 are considered to be consuming reactants and producing products in the reverse direction.
        - Reactions with a flux greater than 0 are considered to be producing reactants and consuming products in the forward direction.
        - This applies for the specific medium provided with the model
